				<h2 class="h5">Background and Motivation</h2>
				<hr class="w-25 mb-3" />
				<p>On the first day of class, when we were asked which social issue we cared most about, we both mentioned food insecurity and the importance of ensuring that everyone has access to basic nutritional needs. That shared interest became the driving force behind our project idea.</p>

				<p>Despite record levels of global food production, millions of people continue to face chronic hunger. Our goal is to visualize this imbalance and make the scale of the issue tangible. This topic is especially relevant in the current global context, where conflict and economic instability are exacerbating hunger in certain regions. In some cases, food is even used as a weapon, with populations being intentionally deprived of resources. By visualizing where and why food insecurity persists, we hope to spark greater awareness and encourage data-driven discussions around solutions such as reducing waste, improving distribution, and increasing sustainable production.</p>

				<h2 class="h5">Project Objectives</h2>
				<hr class="w-25 mb-3" />
				<p>Primary questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the current severity of food insecurity in different regions of the world?</li>
                    <li>How does the current volume of food production and the current volume of food loss/waste compare across regions?</li>
                    <li>Which regions appear to be handling food production and distribution more efficiently (i.e., high production + low waste + lower hunger)? Which regions appear most vulnerable (higher waste or low production + high insecurity)?</li>
                    <li>What might the inefficiencies suggest about possible interventions (i.e. is there a better way to distribute food)?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What we would like to learn and accomplish:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li>Determine whether the world currently produces enough food to meet global nutritional needs.</li>
                    <li>Identify regions where food insecurity remains high despite high food production, revealing possible inequities or inefficiencies in distribution.</li>
                    <li>Compare food production, waste, and insecurity on a single visual platform to show how these factors interact.</li>
				</ul>
                <p>Benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shows if global hunger is more impacted by production or an inefficient allocation of resources.</li>
                    <li>Raises awareness to a complex issue and begins a discussion to come up with solutions.</li>
                </ul>

				<p>We do not expect to have a lot of data cleanup since there will be key metrics that we are looking for. This numbers are given in the links from the data section, and we can manually convert them into a readable json file. </p>
				<p> Key Metrics: 
				<ul>
					<li>How much food is produced by each continent (For optional feature of breakdown of what the food waste type is (waste by food type))</li>
					<li>How much food is wasted by each continent </li>
					<li>Total food insecurity globally (Optional filtering : by continent ) </li>

							<p>The final visualization uses a Sankey diagram and supporting visuals. We chose a Sankey diagram to illustrate the flow of food from each continent into the outcomes: food consumed and food wasted. We chose this over the world map visualizations because they were less successful at conveying food flow and immediate quantitative data. The bar charts visually compare the total tons of food wasted to the estimated tons required to solve food insecurity. We also added an additional visualization that breaks down waste percentages by food category for additional nuance and connection to systemic inefficiencies. </p>
